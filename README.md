# Roller

A websocket based multiplayer dice rolling site. Multiple people can join a
room and make rolls in the form `<num>d<sides>+<bonus>`. The rolls are then
sent to everyone in the room.

## Installation

Right now, the application is started by using `Roller.setup` in iex.
Loading `res/index.html` will connect to the server.
